## Usage
An example usage scenario with tasks (tasks are indicated in brackets, i.e. [task], and are optional to include)

Mary is a policy maker with the Canadian Ministry of Health and she wants to understand what factors lead to missed appointments in order to devise an intervention that improves attendance numbers. She wants to be able to [explore] a dataset in order to [compare] the effect of different variables on absenteeism and [identify] the most relevant variables around which to frame her intervention policy. When Mary logs on to the “Missed Appointments app”, she will see an overview of all the available variables in her dataset, according to the number of people that did or did not show up to their medical appointment. She can filter out variables for head-to-head comparisons, and/or rank patients according to their predicted probability of missing an appointment. When she does so, Mary may notice that “physical disability” appears to be a strong predictor missing appointments, and in fact patients with a physical disability also have the largest number of missed appointments. She hypothesizes that patients with a physical disability could be having a hard time finding transportation to their appointments, and decides she needs to conduct a follow-on study since transportation information is not captured in her current dataset.
